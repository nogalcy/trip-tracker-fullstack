### This is a navigation repo for the trip tracker fullstack project, as it is easier to deploy on Render when the frontend and backend are separate github repositories

# The website is deployed [here](https://trip-tracker-v8v4.onrender.com)

# The frontend source code is [here](https://github.com/nogalcy/trip-tracker-frontend)

# The backend source code is [here](https://github.com/nogalcy/trip-tracker-backend)
